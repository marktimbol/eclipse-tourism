                'description'   =>  '<p>Visit the Gold Souk to see the large variety of gold sold at really reasonable prices.  Prices are generally determined by weight rather than design and craftsmanship. Watch out for different designs in earrings, rings, necklaces, chains, bracelets, bangles and pendants. Designs can be traditional or modern, bold or conservative, loud or sober, sturdy or delicate. Along with designs, you will find many different shades of gold like pink, white, yellow or green hues in one piece. Dubai Gold Souk is worth a visit even if you have no intention of buying. It would be hard to resist the temptation to buy them. </p>

                                    <p>Prices are very competitive. Remember, Dubai is a tax-free country, making gold much cheaper. Dealers come here from around the globe and strict regulations are followed. Gold prices are based on a standard rate per gram that changes very frequently. Of course, it also depends on the carat.....the amount of gold in the mixture. </p>

                                    <h3>Carat quantities in gold fall into four categories</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>24 carat</li>
                                        <li>22 carat</li>
                                        <li>18 carat</li>
                                        <li>14 carat</li>
                                        <li>9 carat</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Dubai has stringent laws on gold markings</h3>

                                    <p>All gold must be labelled accurately and Government officials regularly check the markings. On top of this, price also depends, quite naturally, on the workmanship that has gone into a particular item. </p>

                                    <p>The Gold Souq is the biggest gold market in the U.A.E. There are said to be more than 125 shops here, selling silver, pearls, diamonds and rubies, as well as gold items fashioned in the differing styles of many countries. </p>

                                    <p>Different shops specialise in specific kinds of gold items, such as Indian gold, Italian gold and Arabic gold. The best Arabic designs come from Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, but designs of all tastes and fashions can be found here in the gold souk. </p>

                                    <p>The souks carry everything that can be made from gold, but if there is some personal design you cannot find, they will make it for you. These are very highly skilled craftsmen and always keen to make a sale and to please the customer.  Most of the gold salesmen are either Indian or Lebanese. They are very experienced at persuading tourists to part with their money. Remember, it is essential and expected to haggle over a price. </p>

                                    <p>It is best to start at around half the asking price and to haggle or bargain with a smile!!</p>

                                    <p>Also known as the Old Souk, as the name suggests it is the largest and the oldest souk in Dubai city. The spice souk has a number of narrow lanes dotted with open and closed roof spice shops. As you walk along the winding streets, you can see traders as well as shoppers haggling with the shop keepers. Bargaining is an entirely new experience and to watch the “professional hagglers” carrying on is a sight to behold. Since the Dubai spice souk is the oldest one around, it looks more traditional than the others. Once you step into the market, you feel as if you have been transported back in time. </p>

                                    <p>The colorful array of spices and their heady aroma is tantalizing. You cannot get over the incredible number of spices that are available. The shops at the Dubai spice souk sell spices like cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, nuts, cloves, henna and lots more. And that’s not all; you will also find basmati rice, incense or joss sticks, shisha and tobacco, seductive perfumes, pottery as well as baskets. As you move on from one shop to another, you will be enveloped by these sensory delights. The spices are brought from the Middle Eastern region as well as from around other parts of the world. You can buy them on wholesale rates and end up saving a lot of money. </p>

                                    <p>Another fascinating sight is watching the wholesaler packing your purchases which were packed and shipped in Hessian pouches. This keeps the spices fresh and aromatic for a long time. Without any doubts, they are spices of the highest quality and reasonably priced at the same time. The world famous Arab dried fruits are also available. Spices and dried fruits make excellent gifts for special occasions. Food lovers can go wild and buy them to experiment authentic Arab cuisines. </p>',

This lingering trail leaves a mark in your life and remains fresh in your memory. Such is the specialty of the fragrances at the Dubai perfume souk. At the souk, you will not just find traditional Arabian ittar, but also branded and designer perfumes from around the world.

                                    <p>The best time to visit the Dubai fish souk is early in the morning and at late nights. As it is with all fish markets, this souk is also very smelly and dirty. The souk is not meant for people with weak stomachs. People who cannot stand the rancid smells and the butchers at their work should not come to the fish souk. Those who can, it would be indeed smart on their part if they wore old clothes and shoes; in case they get spoiled you can always throw them away. Else, better it&rsquo;s better to go waterproof. For the most part, the Dubai fish souk attracts a lot of photographers. You can find them trying to capture the abundant and bizarre varieties of fish displayed in the stores.</p>

                                    <p>A fishing museum also lies nearby, which showcases the fishing culture of Dubai and the neighboring areas. Fishing has been a part of the rich heritage of the region and with the Dubai fish souk; it relives the habits and practices followed by traders back in the day. If you find fish markets exciting, then a visit to this old-fashioned souk is definitely worthwhile.</p>',
